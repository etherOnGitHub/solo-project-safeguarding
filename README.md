| User Type  |  Brief |
| :---:	| --- |
| **💁🏾 External User’s Goal** | The user seeks clear, easy-to-understand information on safeguarding practices, including how to recognize and respond to safeguarding concerns. |
| **🧑🏻‍💼 Site Owner’s Goal** |  The site owner wants to create a straightforward webpage that outlines the key principles of safeguarding using clear, structured content with basic HTML and CSS. The layout should be simple and intuitive, making the information easy to access and understand. |

</center>

## ♣️ Purpose

The general purpose of the website is to educate and inform people on safeguarding practices so it needs to be concise and easy to follow; so the layout needs to be compact and small chunks of highly dense information. Delivered in a cool and friendly manor. The website has an embedded video too to watch for eductation.

### User value

The value to the user is that information regarding safeguarding and its practices are quick and easy to access. There is also a newsletter and report form so the user can seek more additional resources while not having to access any additional sites or pages. 

## 📐 Planning & Development

### Wireframes

<p></p>

The wireframes helped visualise how the design may look and I did deviate from it a bit but I think in a positive direction, a more interesting direction.

### Overall User Experience
#### Mobile-First Approach
Mobile is the largest audience to target so it makes sense to build websites with mobile in mind first.
<p>

<p></p>
<br>
As you can see the website collapses down into a single column for scrolling and has a navbar at the top that collapses down to see the main headings on the page. This means that it is very easy to navigate all the elements even withing the restricted screen space. The footer contains external links to other pages that could be set up for the organisation.

#### Desktop
Desktop view consolidates all the sections of the page into a wider view range, with the central column being the largest to fit a video within the column. The elements align across the page making use of grids to condense the information on a wide screen.
<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/etherOnGitHub/solo-project-safeguarding/blob/main/assets/readme/main-page-carousel-user-experience.webp" alt="Desktop display of main carousel"/>
</p>
 The main banner upon loading hides the navbar below the splash page. Upon scrolling down the navbar appears and the lower body content is displayed.

</p>
Here the website is condensed down into those columns that are highlighted red. More information is visible and accessible but the main navbar and footer elements are consistent with mobile.

## 🔌Use of AI

GitHub Copilot was used during the creation of this website, used as a tool for assisting in creation of content and **_not_** as a replacement for building the website. AI is good for assisting but often makes vital mistakes and errors along the building process.

ChatGPT was used to generate images for the content as well as help generate some body text that is concise and informative, it refined the text given to be short and to the point in some cases.

### 🪳 Identifying Issues and Bugs
#### Example A - Set up my basic file structure!

An example use case of AI is to sidestep creating the folders and file structures to save time on menial tasks to focus more on development. It is quite reliable at creating these structures for you but it can sometimes, if you dont specify it not to, can generate a javascript folder or name soemthing wrong so its best to specify what you need with it.

</p>

#### Example B - CSS syntax bug

AI is great at squashing syntax errors without wasting 5 minutes reading line by line throught the code. This increase my workrate exponentially as any syntax errors are immediately detected.

</p>

#### Example C - Image cropping in ChatGPT

Some generated images needed further cropping to resolve issues with the navbar element.

  <sub>Link to image in repo: https://github.com/etherOnGitHub/solo-project-safeguarding/blob/main/assets/readme/AI-picture-need-crop.webp</sub>
</p>

#### Example D - Border Radius

Identified the text area property for Bootstrap to make the radius 0.

  <sub>Link to image in repo: https://github.com/etherOnGitHub/solo-project-safeguarding/blob/main/assets/readme/AI-border-radius-textarea.webp</sub>
</p>

### Downfalls

I encountered an error with the program where it wouldn't engage with the issue, this only happened rarely and when it did it was a case of changing how the prompt was worded.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/etherOnGitHub/solo-project-safeguarding/blob/main/assets/readme/AI-problems.webp" alt="Image showing AI unable to fix code" width="800"/><br>
  <sub>Link to image in repo: https://github.com/etherOnGitHub/solo-project-safeguarding/blob/main/assets/readme/AI-problems.webp</sub>
</p>

Occasionally the transormer model would just not fix the issue despite accurate instructions given, usually to do with styling. It can also introduce bugs when it adds a section of code to your work, in those cases I usually would delete the code and proceed manually.

### AI, is it worth it?

AI definitely has its use cases as a tool to speed up the menial work in coding, whether thats creating forms and tables or columns and sections. It does this with ease and most of the time great accuracy. I find its used best to tackle specific issues that have been given context to help 'guide' its methodology. Often I find myself renaming the ID selectors it uses or the field names it creates. Styling is a lot easier done by hand in most cases, although, since I am yet to learn JavaScript (as of writing) it has helped with some rudimentary JS queries.
