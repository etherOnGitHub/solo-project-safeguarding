Clear commit history

Clean, commented code

No leftover commented-out code

All internal links and interactive elements must work

📄 5. Documentation
Create a concise README.md:

Purpose of the app

Who benefits and how

How to deploy it

Include screenshots + feature descriptions

Attribute any code you didn’t write

🤖 6. AI Integration
Mention where you used AI to generate code

Reflect on AI’s help with debugging and performance optimisation

Discuss how AI tools affected your workflow (briefly, don’t write a novel)

Put these reflections in your README
