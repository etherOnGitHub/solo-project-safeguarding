| User Type  |  Brief |
| :---:	| --- |
| **💁🏾 External User’s Goal** | The user seeks clear, easy-to-understand information on safeguarding practices, including how to recognize and respond to safeguarding concerns. |

## ♣️ Purpose

The general purpose of the website is to educate and inform people on safeguarding practices so it needs to be concise and easy to follow; so the layout needs to be compact and small chunks of highly dense information. Delivered in a cool and friendly manor. The website has an embedded video too to watch for eductation.

### User value

The value to the user is that information regarding safeguarding and its practices are quick and easy to access. There is also a newsletter and report form so the user can seek more additional resources while not having to access any additional sites or pages.
